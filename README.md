# Nl2-Script-Stuff
Just like a lot of scripting stuff for nl2

If I have time or someone else would like to create a little help guide for using these apis that would be great.
These are for more niche tasks/tools such as raycasting, parsing etc

Feel free to contribute to this with other helpful stuff
Enjoy!
